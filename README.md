## What is "Dynarchiving"?
"Dynarchiving" is meant as a creative and practical intervention to address an as yet oftentimes overlooked problematic.

## What does "The Toolkit" consist of?

It provides a practical tool-kit for archival institutions like museums, libraries, universities, archives of any kind. They can add the free tools to their websites, i.e. single posts or pages: historical records, databases, digitized papers, any kind of archival material they publish.

The tools address users at the exact moment when they are accessing and searching the respective sites.

For the time being, these tools are:

- 2 custom cursors
- 1 message-bot
- 1 chatbot
