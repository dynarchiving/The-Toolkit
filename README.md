# Dynarchiving: The Toolkit

The aim of the project is to contribute to the slowly but surely emerging debate on data bias and to offer approaches to de-bias knowledge production and confront the existing bias in archives.

## What is "Dynarchiving"?
It is designed as a creative and practical intervention to address an as yet oftentimes overlooked problematic.

## What does "The Toolkit" consist of?

It provides a practical tool-kit for archival institutions like museums, libraries, universities, archives of any kind. They can add the free tools to their websites, i.e. single posts or pages: historical records, databases, digitized papers, any kind of archival material they publish.

The tools address users at the exact moment when they are accessing and searching the respective sites.

For the time being, these tools are:

- 2 custom cursors – with an endless loop
- 2 custom cursors – the loop stops after 15 seconds
- 1 message-bot
- 1 chatbot
